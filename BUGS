			     Marble Bugs
			     ===========

This is the Marble bug file.  It exists mainly so that we can see what
bugsthere are before we start using the KDE bugzilla for real.


Classification
--------------

BUG	     Something is wrong; this should be fixed

ENHANCEMENT  Do something already existing in a better way.

FEATURE      The application should do something new.  

If we want to implement one or more of these for a certain version, it
should be listed in the TODO file.  This file is just a collection.


The bugs
--------

0001 BUG

  The "bullet points" on the left of geographical objects are not
  vertically aligned with the text -- intended? 

  tackat: Yes, it's intended. Labels on maps are usually placed in
  certain discrete allowed positions to avoid overlap of the
  labels. In Marble the labels are placed either on the top left, top
  right, left bottom or right bottom.


0002 FEATURE

  Panning with the nav buttons on the left should be smooth --
  otherwise it's irritating.

  tackat: Well that's not easy to solve. As you pointed out there are
  still installs where Marble is slower than on others. "Smooth"
  scrolling would take eternally long on these if not implemented
  taking into account such scenarios. So currently the current
  solution is just the pragmatic solution to give fast navigation to
  all users.


0003 BUG

  Why are some cities titled in italic? Maybe add a legend thing at
  first run, easily closable. 

  tackat: That's indeed an oversight on my part. It was originally
  mentioned in the Legend what the font properties (bold, underlined,
  etc.) were meant to represent.  in the city data sheet:


0004 BUG

  Flags needs a border

  tackat: Yes, it only now occured to me that the widget could be
  white indeed (very unlikely for the final version but ...). I don't
  want to add a border. But I'll add a slight shadow instead.


0005 BUG

  "city" should be right aligned, on the same row as the name of the
  city

  tackat: No. There is enough space below the name of the city. But
  for some languages putting it into the same line as the name of the
  placemark (which is very long in some cases already) this would
  definetely conflict with the length of the translation of the
  placemark type ("Capital", "Capital of Region", etc.).


0006 ENHANCEMENT

  "Short Description" field should be omitted when no short description
  is available.

  tackat: I applied another change in recent SVN instead which makes
  the Wikipedia feature more visible.


0007 ENHANCEMENT

  What is "Download Finished"?

  tackat: I'll turn this into "Wikipedia data download
  finished". Better :-) ?


0008 ENHANCEMENT

  "Data sheet" sounds pretty technical. How about "information"?

  tackat: Accidently I used "Data Sheet" in two places: The Window
  title and the tab. The first tab should indeed be just a "data
  sheet" (Information is pretty useless as basically everything on the
  screen is "information". Naming the Window title "Data Sheet" is
  indeed an oversight from the times where the Wikipedia tab didn't
  exist. I'll name it "Marble Info Center" instead.


0009 ENHANCEMENT

  The list of geographical objects on the left doesn't respect my
  singleclick settings.

  tackat: I want to avoid that if you go through the list using cursor
  keys that each key press triggers a map update. That's why you need
  to either double click or click once and press "Enter" to trigger a
  map update. I will look into this issue.


0010 ENHANCEMENT

  Make the list flexible, instead of the zoom slider.

  tackat: No.


0011 ENHANCEMENT

  The navigation sidebar should be a qdockwidget.

  tackat: Yes, it's far from ideal yet and we do indeed think about
  using a solution similar to a QDockWidget instead.


0012 FEATURE

  Make measure points draggable.

  tackat: That would be a cool feature indeed. For now I think there
  are more important things to fix though given that the
  implementation of this feature would pose quite a challenge.

0014 ENHANCEMENT
 
  Fast mouse panning is ignored.

  tackat: What's "fast" mouse panning meant to be?


0015 BUG

  Black text sometimes gets lost in the deep space blackness, when
  completely zoomed out.

  tackat: That's a know issue. The problem is that I haven't heard
  anybody come up with a really good solution (And no, I neither want
  outlines used everywhere nor changing font colors, nor opaque
  labels).


0016 ENHANCEMENT

  Country borders are aliased.

  tackat: I hardly can change that for the rendering while moving the
  map (It would be _really_ slow due to the node count. But I'll
  probably add a feature any day now that will make the final
  rendering (once the map doesn't move anymore) high quality with all
  possible kinds of Antialiasing enabled. That will require some code
  though.


0017 ENHANCEMENT

  The places where land touches sea/snow have a "vector boundary" -
  this is aliased as well.

  tackat: Yes, and would be really really slow if we wanted
  antialiasing here as well.


0018 ENHANCEMENT

  Panning and zooming are quite slow on my machine -- AMD Sempron
  2300+, 512MB RAM, nVidia GeForce FX 5500 with binary drivers.

  tackat: Do a "marble --timedemo" on the command line to define
  "slow". Yes, it's a known issue that certain AMD + ... combinations
  are incredibly slow. This is partially due to crappy X drivers. I
  still yet have to see marble on Windows running "slow" ;-( We are
  working on it but it's not easy to fix.


0019 ENHANCEMENT

  Disable zoom buttons if max or min zoom level is reached --icwiener

  "tackat: cool idea. I'll add that ASAP. Should be easy to do."
