This TODO file outlines a few ideas that we have for future Marble
development. 
Of course there are lots of things that we have in mind that could

ideas only help so much as long as the person coming up with 
an idea also commits itself to implement the feature near-term.

Therefore the actual TODO list is rather located at:
