    - Move paintBase to ProjectionHelper				done
    - Move activeArea to ProjectionHelper				inge
 
    - <strikeout>Move mapCoversImage (prev. globeCoversImage) to ProjectionHelper</strikeout>
      "mapCoversImage" is NOT meant to go to ProjectionHelper.
       The projection's main intent is to map e.g. a set of 
       geo coordinates onto a value set (i.e. the image/screen coordinates. 
       "mapCoversImage" just describes whether there are invalid 
       screen coordinates which don't belong to the value set. 
       Hence mapCoversImage fits perfectly into the projection classes.
       Actually it should rather get named "projectionCoversImage"  
       but I guess mapCoversImage brings the point across better.

Longer Explanations for some things
================================================================

The following are longer explanations for some features so that we
don't have to explain them in the list above and thus get better
overview.


RenderingQuality in ViewParams
------------------------------

For performance reasons, Marble should render the map in different
qualities in different situations.

 - LOW: For slow hardware with different defaults
    - No relief in Atlas View
    - using setShowQuickAndDirty(true) for really sloppy interpolation
 - MEDIUM: Basically what we have now
 - HIGH: Uses Antialiased vector lines
 - PRINT: Adds some Really Slow (TM) nice things that are typical for
   printed maps: e.g. Blue antialiased coast lines for the Atlas map.

 ** Make Marble use different render settings while panning (MOVE) and
    after releasing the mouse (DROP)

    For KDE 4.0.1 it should use the render quality MEDIUM for panning
    and HIGH or PRINT after the mouse button has been released. Note:
    For KDE 4.1 there should be two comboboxes in the settings dialog:

    Display Quality:

    During mouse move: [^ Medium ]
    On mouse drop:     [^ High   ]

 ** Rerender the map at "PRINT quality" once "File -> Print" or 
    "Edit -> Copy" get selected.


Small indicator in the status bar for downloads
-----------------------------------------------
    downloads (should be really tiny and not obtrusive just to see
    that something is going on). Ideally the user would get a tooltip
    once he hovers that progress bar with numbers of files in the
    queue, maybe amount of data that has been downloaded during the
    session.
