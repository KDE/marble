There are some applications/applets/plasmoids using Marble. They might be
affected by changes of the Marble API.

So it is good practice to check if the following applications compile and
work after API changes:

- extragear/graphics/digikam
- extragear/graphics/kphotoalbum
- playground/base/plasma/applets/contacts
- playground/base/plasma/wallpapers/marble
- playground/office/geoshape

There is this link https://techbase.kde.org/Marble/MarbleUsedBy
listing also applications not hosted in KDE svn.
