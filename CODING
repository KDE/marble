                     Coding Standards for Marble
                     ===========================


This file contains the coding standards for Marble.  If you want to
add or change code in Marble, you must follow these standards.


Foundation
----------

The foundation for these standards is the kdelibs coding style.  It is
described here: http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style
I suggest that you start by reading that document, it's not long.


Recapitulation
--------------

Let's recapitulate a few key points from the kdelibs coding
style. This is not the full standard, but just the most important
points.

 - 4 spaces indentation
 - no tabs in the source code
 - opening braces at end of line (except struct, class, functions and
   namespaces) 
 - as little abbreviation in variable names as possible
 - one variable declaration per line
 - whitespace after control statements
 - no space after pointer or reference ('*foo', not '* foo')
 - no lines longer than 100 chars.

That's a very short recapitulation of the above mentioned document.
The full document contains lots of examples to show how it should be
done.


Extensions
----------

The style defined above is not complete, so we have added the
following item:


Broken Lines in Expressions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If an expression is so long that the line has to be broken, the break
should occur *in front of* an operator, not *behind* it.

Example:

   var = very_long_sub_expression
         + another_very_long_sub_expression;

If you use emacs, you can make it auto-indent by adding parenthesis to
the expression like this:

   var = ( very_long_sub_expression
           + another_very_long_sub_expression );


Another common case for this is logical expressions for if statements:

   if ( very_long_sub_expression
        && another_very_long_sub_expression )
      doSomething();

See also below for how to handle braces in this case.


Exceptions
----------

The Marble coding style has a couple of exceptions to the foundation.


Spaces and Parenthesis
- - - - - - - - - - - 

Due to historic reasons, the coding style of Marble havs one
exception to the kdelibs style.  That exception is that we use the Qt
way of using parenthesis, with a space inside both opening and closing
parenthesis.  For example

Correct:

   if ( width > 100 ) {
      setHeight( 200 );
   }


Wrong:

   if (width > 100) {
      setHeight(200);
   }


Braces After Multi-line Expressions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

When an 'if' or 'while' statement has a long logical expression, the
following braces should be put at the beginning of the next line to
increase readability.

Correct:

   if ( very_long_sub_expression
        && another_very_long_sub_expression )
   {
       doSomething();
       doSomethingElse();
   }

Wrong:

   if ( very_long_sub_expression
        && another_very_long_sub_expression ) {
       doSomething();
       doSomethingElse();
   }

As you can see, it is somewhat difficult to spot where the expression
ends and the action part begins if you just look at the left side.


Settings for Your Editor
------------------------

emacs
- - - 

If you are an emacs user, you can put the following lines in your
.emacs file.  Then these style guielines will be followed almost
automatically:


;; Don't use tabs in indentation
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; Use 4 space indentation
(setq-default c-basic-offset 4)


kate
- - 

Somebody who knows kate should add settings here.


vim
- -

If you are a vim user, add the following to your ~/.vimrc file.

:set cindent
:set tabstop=4
:set shiftwidth=4
:set expandtab
