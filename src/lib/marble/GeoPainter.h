    \class GeoPainter
    \brief A painter that allows to draw geometric primitives on the map.

    This class allows application developers to draw simple geometric shapes
    and objects onto the map.

    The API is modeled after the QPainter API.

    The GeoPainter provides a wide range of methods that are using geographic
    ("geodesic") coordinates to position the item.
    For example a point or the nodes of a polygon can fully be described in
    geographic coordinates.

    In all these cases the position of the object is specified in geographic
    coordinates.

    There are however some cases where there are two viable cases:
    \li the shape of the object could still use screen coordinates (like a label
    or an icon).
    \li Alternatively the shape of the object can get projected according
    to the current projection (e.g. a texture projected onto the spherical
    surface)
    
    If screen coordinates are used then e.g. width and height are assumed to be
    expressed in pixels, otherwise degrees are used.

    Painter transformations (e.g. translate) always happen in screen
    coordinates.

    Like in QPainter drawing objects onto a widget should always considered to
    be a volatile operation. This means that e.g. placemarks don't get added to
    the globe permanently.
    So the drawing needs to be done on every repaint to prevent that drawings
    will disappear during the next paint event.

    So if you want to add placemarks to your map widget permanently (i.e. you
    don't want to take care of repainting) then you need to use other solutions
    such as the KML import of the Marble framework or Marble's GeoGraphicsItems.

    \note By default the GeoPainter automatically filters geographical content
    in order to provide fast painting:
    \li Geographically positioned objects which are outside the viewport are not
    drawn at all.
    Parts of objects which are specified through geographic coordinates
    (like polygons, ellipses etc.) get cut off if they are not placed within the
    viewport.
    \li Objects which have a shape that is specified through geographic
    coordinates get filtered according to the viewport resolution:
    If the object is much smaller than a pixel then it won't get drawn at all.

    \brief Draws a text annotation that points to a geodesic position.

    The annotation consists of a bubble with the specified \a text inside.
    By choosing an appropriate pen for the painter it's possible to change
    the color and line style of the bubble outline and the text. The brush
    chosen for the painter is used to paint the background of the bubble

    The optional parameters which describe the layout of the bubble are
    similar to those used by QPainter::drawRoundedRect().
    Unlike in QPainter the rounded corners are not specified in percentage
    but in pixels to provide for optimal aesthetics.
    By choosing a positive or negative bubbleOffset it's possible to
    place the annotation on top, bottom, left or right of the annotated
    position.
    
    \param position The geodesic position
    \param text The text contained by the bubble
    \param bubbleSize The size of the bubble that holds the annotation text.
                      A height of 0 can be used to have the height calculated
                      automatically to fit the needed text height.
    \param bubbleOffsetX The x-axis offset between the annotated position and
                         the "root" of the speech bubble's "arrow".
    \param bubbleOffsetY The y-axis offset between the annotated position and
                         the "root" of the speech bubble's "arrow".
    \param xRnd Specifies the geometry of the rounded corners in pixels along
                the x-axis.
    \param yRnd Specifies the geometry of the rounded corners in pixels along
                the y-axis.
