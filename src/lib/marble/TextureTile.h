/*!
    \class TextureTile
    \brief A class that resembles an image tile (extends Tile).

    This tile provides a bitmap image for a certain (geographic) area and
    for a given zoom level. Each Tile can be identified via a unique
    TileId.

    A stack of Tiles that cover the same area and the same
    zoom level can be stored (and painted) layer by layer in a StackedTile object.
    For this purpose each Tile specifies a blending type.

    Usually the tiles are organized in so called quad tiles: This means that
    with increasing zoom level four other tiles cover the same area as a
    single "parent" tile in the previous zoom level. These four tiles have
    the same pixel size as the "parent" tile.

    The process of "filling the tile with data is done in stages: The
    State describes the current progress of loading the data (Empty, Scaled,
    Expired, StateUptodate).

    The life time cycle of a Tile can also be influenced by its
    expiration time which will trigger a reload of the tile data.
