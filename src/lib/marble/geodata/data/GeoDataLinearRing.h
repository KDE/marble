    \class GeoDataLinearRing
    \brief A LinearRing that allows to store a closed, contiguous set of line segments.

    GeoDataLinearRing is a tool class that implements the LinearRing tag/class
    of the Open Geospatial Consortium standard KML 2.2.

    Unlike suggested in the KML spec GeoDataLinearRing extends GeoDataLineString
    to store a closed LineString (the KML specification suggests to inherit from
    the Geometry class directly).

    In the QPainter API LinearRings are also referred to as "polygons".
    As such they are similar to QPolygons.

    Whenever a LinearRing is painted GeoDataLineStyle should be used to assign a
    color and line width.

    A GeoDataLinearRing consists of several (geodetic) nodes which are each
    connected through line segments. The nodes are stored as GeoDataCoordinates
    objects.

    The API which provides access to the nodes is similar to the API of
    QVector.

    GeoDataLinearRing allows LinearRings to be tessellated in order to make them
    follow the terrain and the curvature of the earth. The tessellation options
    allow for different ways of visualization:

    \li Not tessellated: A LinearRing that connects each two nodes directly and
        straight in screen coordinate space.
    \li A tessellated line: Each line segment is bent so that the LinearRing
        follows the curvature of the earth and its terrain. A tessellated
        line segment connects two nodes at the shortest possible distance
        ("along great circles").
    \li A tessellated line that follows latitude circles whenever possible:
        In this case Latitude circles are followed as soon as two subsequent
        nodes have exactly the same amount of latitude. In all other places the
        line segments follow great circles.

    Some convenience methods have been added that allow to calculate the
    geodesic bounding box or the length of a LinearRing.
