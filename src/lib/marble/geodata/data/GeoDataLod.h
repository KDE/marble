    \class GeoDataLod
    \brief The level of detail which indicates visibility and importance.

    GeoDataLod is a tool class that implements the Lod tag/class
    of the Open Geospatial Consortium standard KML 2.2.

    "Lod" is an abbreviation for "Level of Detail" and refers to 
    the extent of the region of a feature.
    In geodesic coordinates the size of the region can be described 
    in terms of a LatLon(Alt)Box. 
    Projected to screen coordinates the size of a region would naturally
    be measured in pixels.
    The size of such a region varies depending on the distance of the 
    observer towards the feature. 
    
    The "Level of Detail" describes how many pixels a region needs to
    cover in order to be considered "active" and visible. 
    It also describes how "quickly" the feature fades in and out.
