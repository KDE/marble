/**
 * Converts the x and y indices of tiles to and from geo coordinates.
 * For tiles of maps in Mercator projection.
 *
 * Tiles do have the same width and the same height per zoomlevel.
 * The number of tiles per dimension is twice that of the previous lower zoomlevel.
 * The indexing is done in x dimension eastwards, with the first tiles beginning at -180 degree
 * and an x value of 0 and the last tiles ending at +180 degree,
 * in y dimension southwards with the first tiles beginning at +85.05113 degree and a y value of 0
 * and the last tiles ending at -85.05113 degree.
 *
 * NOTE: The method @c tileIndexes() handles any latitude value >= +85.0 degree as
 * exactly +85.0 degree and any latitude value <= -85.0 as exactly -85.0 degree.
 * So for higher zoomlevels the outermost tiles will be masked by that and not included in any results.
