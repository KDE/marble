# A script to download Marble Qt translations from KDE's SVN,
# transform them to binary .qm format while limiting the scope
# of translations to driving instructions. The output is a set
# of routing-instructions_$lang.qm files that can be used to
# have the routing-instructions binary translate driving 
# instructions according to the system's locale.
