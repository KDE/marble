# Marble

Marble is a virtual globe and world atlas â€” your swiss army knife for maps that
you can use to learn more about the Earth and other planets.

## Get It

Details on where to find stable releases of Marble can be found on its
[homepage](https://apps.kde.org/marble).

## Building

The easiest way to make changes and test Marble during development is to [build it with kdesrc-build](https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/building/).
